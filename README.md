# mentalityapp
Project #1 IDEA: An webpage that displays a collection of quotes from prominent POC/Female authors with a randomized Unsplash picture. Together, the webpage functions can function as affirmations/quote app for writers, creators or lovers of literature and photography alike. 
Future application: I would like the app to also provide literature recommendations	on the quote section of the app, and travel recommendations on the photography side of the page. Furthermore, I would like the page to one day have the ability to be tailored to each users tastes.
